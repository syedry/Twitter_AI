Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Twitter AI Agent Web App

Overview 
This web app enables users to create and manage Twitter-based AI agents that mimic specific personalities or styles. The AI agents will auto-post tweets, generate replies, and provide manual tweet generation functionality.

Core Features


1.	Dashboard
o	Display a list of AI agents created by the user.
o	Provide options to edit an AI agent or generate tweets.
o	Support the creation of new AI agents.
2.	Create AI Agent
o	Input Fields:
	Knowledge source: Select a Twitter profile for the AI to mimic (e.g., "Elon Musk").
	AI character description: Define the agent’s style, personality, and interests.
	Tweet priorities: Set the type of content (e.g., news commentary or philosophical musings).
	Language and tone: Specify tone and style (e.g., "Casual and friendly").
o	Generate suggestions for prompts to assist users with defining their agents.
o	Provide a testing interface to preview generated tweets in real-time.
o	Finalize and save the AI agent after refining inputs.
3.	Agent Management
o	Pulling All Their Tweets
	API Endpoints for Fetching Tweets:
	Use endpoints like GET /2/users/:id/tweets to fetch a user's tweets. For an activity panel showing historical tweets:
	Implement pagination to retrieve more than the default number of tweets (usually around 20-100 per request).
	Be mindful of rate limits. Even with higher tier access, manage requests to not exceed these limits.
	Displaying in Activity Panel:
	After fetching, store or cache these tweets in your backend system to display them in the user's dashboard or activity panel.
o	Posting on X
	API Endpoint for Tweeting:
	Use the POST /2/tweets endpoint to create new tweets on behalf of the authenticated user. This allows your AI agents to auto-post or for users to manually post via your interface.
	Labeling Tweets as Automated:
	Ensure your app adds the label "Automated" to tweets created by the AI. This can be part of the tweet body or possibly through metadata tags if supported by the API (Twitter's policy might require this for transparency).
4.	Auto-Reply and Engagement (Bonus Feature)
o	Fetch tweet replies via the Twitter API and enable the AI to auto-reply.
o	Follow specified accounts, view their feed, and engage by replying to tweets.
5.	Automated Label on Tweets
o	Ensure tweets generated by the AI are labeled as "Automated" via the Twitter API for transparency.

Technical Requirements


•	Backend
o	Set up data structures demonstrating relationships between users and AI agents.
o	Each user can create one AI agent (max).
o	The tool will use Scrapingdog API to scrape X/Twitter.
•	API Integrations
o	Twitter API:
	Integrate for auto-tweeting, fetching replies, and labeling tweets.
	User Authentication:
	Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication with X. Each user will need to log in and grant your app permission to access their account, resulting in unique access tokens for each user.
	API Key Management:
	Your application's API key (Consumer Key and Secret) is for your app's identity, not for direct access to user data. It's used to initiate the OAuth flow for each user.
•	OpenAI API:
o	Use the provided API key for tweet generation.
•	Authentication
o	Build a simple auth system for users to access the tool.
